# AutoRedirect Configuration Examples
# Lines starting with # will be ignored as comment
# ===== Rule Explanation =====
# https://playeryk.github.io/AutoRedirect/

# ===== Exact Match Mode (Recommended, Safest) =====
# Use = prefix to match only identical URLs, avoiding accidental triggers
# Suitable for specific domains or complete URL redirections
=localhost:3000####https://www.example.com

# ===== Prefix Match Mode (Recommended Format) =====
# Use standard domain format to avoid being treated as search terms by browsers
# Recommended to use .localhost, .local or localhost with port
^dev.localhost####https://development.example.com
^api.localhost####https://api.example.com
^localhost:8####https://development.example.com
staging.internal*####https://staging.example.com

# ===== URL Template Replacement Feature =====
# Use * wildcard and {1}, {2}, {3} placeholders for URL rewriting
# Basic domain replacement: transfer all paths from old-domain.com to new-domain.com
old-domain.com/*####new-domain.com/{1}
# Complex path rewriting: reorganize URL structure
example.com/*/page/*####https://newsite.com/{1}/newpage/{2}
# Reuse placeholders: same capture group can be used multiple times
user.com/profile/*####newuser.com/{1}/dashboard/{1}

# ===== Automatic URL Extraction Feature =====
# Empty target URL for automatic URL parameter extraction and decoding
# Automatically skip intermediate redirect pages, go directly to target website

# ===== Exact Local File Redirection =====
# Complete file:// protocol path matching (most precise matching method)
=file:///Downloads/full/test_local.html####https://www.example.com/full/

# ===== Cross-User Local File Redirection =====
# Cross-user universal local development environment mapping (exact match, avoid conflicts with other rules)
=file:///Users/*/dev/*/pickone/*.html####https://production.example.com/{3}

# ===== Specific Project Local File Redirection =====
# ChromeStore project local file redirection (more specific path matching)
*ChromeStore/localfile/*.html$####https://www.example.com/{2}/

# ===== Universal Local File Redirection =====
# Basic file redirection (suffix match, for other projects)
*demo_local.html$####https://www.example.com/demo/

# ===== Special Scenario Configuration (Use with Caution) =====
# The following rules are only for special scenarios, relatively safe in isolated environments
# Suitable for: enterprise intranet, custom protocols, etc.

# Enterprise intranet environment (unified naming convention)
internal-*####https://gateway.company.com/redirect?to={1}
corp-hr####https://hr.company.com
corp-finance####https://finance.company.com

# Custom application protocols (protocol isolation)
myapp://####https://web.myapp.com/
electron-app://####https://app.example.com/

# ===== Multiple Result Selection Test =====
# When a URL matches multiple rules, a selection page will be displayed for user choice
# Use safe exact match and prefix match formats
=search.local####https://www.google.com
=search.local####https://www.bing.com
=search.local####https://www.yahoo.com
# Or use safe prefix match format:
^search.localhost####https://www.google.com
^search.localhost####https://www.bing.com
^search.localhost####https://www.yahoo.com

# ===== Suffix Match Mode =====
# Use * prefix or $ suffix to match URLs ending with specified string
*.localprod####https://production.example.com
*config.json$####https://config.example.com
