AutoRedirect empowers you to take control of your browsing experience by automatically redirecting URLs based on your custom rules. Say goodbye to unwanted intermediate pages, ad trackers, or outdated links, and streamline your workflow.

With AutoRedirect, you can:
- Create custom rules using wildcards (*) or regular expressions for maximum flexibility.
- Skip annoying ad-filled landing pages and go directly to the content.
- Correct common URL typos automatically.
- Create short, memorable aliases for your frequently visited sites.
- Redirect from outdated domains to their new locations seamlessly.
- Sync your rules across different browsers and devices.

AutoRedirect is designed to be lightweight, fast, and privacy-respecting. It operates entirely on your local machine, and your rules are never shared. Take charge of your web navigation and make it work for you.
